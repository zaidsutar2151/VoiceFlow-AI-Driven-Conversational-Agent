# VoiceFlow-AI-Driven-Conversational-Agent

## Overview

This project is a voice-enabled chatbot designed to facilitate interactive conversations using speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies. The chatbot leverages the LLaMA 3 model for generating responses and gTTS for speech synthesis. It can ask predefined questions and generate new ones based on the conversation context.

## Features

- **Voice Input & Output**: Utilizes `speech_recognition` for capturing user responses and `gTTS` for generating speech output.
- **Dynamic Question Generation**: Uses the LLaMA 3 model to generate follow-up questions based on the conversation context.
- **Predefined Questions**: Starts with a set of predefined questions to initiate conversation.
- **Contextual Responses**: Maintains conversation history to generate relevant and context-aware responses.
